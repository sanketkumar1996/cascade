In places like schools and colleges it becomes a tedious task for the teacher to keep a record and maintain the hard copy of
attendance after each and every class.In a class of around an hour it takes almost 10 minutes to take the attendance itself
which logically shouldn’t be a teacher’s job.The teachers and professors have to maintain register, to keep a track of the 
students' attendance.

Students sometime exploit the system of taking attendance in a manual way. They might, mark their attendance and may go out 
to enjoy at the stake of shop. A very common concept of proxy attendance is followed by the students which is not at all ethical.
Id-cards, no one wants anything like that, to be hanged around their neck .Do we? Why can't we do better, when we have the 
resources to exploit to eliminate the process of being using the card to scan the attendance process. And we do know of the
malpractices in it, don't we?

We are mainly focusing on the hourly attendance system, with a will to make it more genuine.

#What is the motto
The idea, is to build a band, a smart one! The band will record the time you spend in a vicinity. No hasseling, or scaning id-cards, 
or marking the attendance. The time, you enter the area, your record will start.
The band will use a connection to a router, which will maintain the database for individual student. And, the information
will be managed by the school authority.
#Working
The band, will be needed to be synchronized to a router system for the first time, whose range can be altered according to 
the classroom’s area. Just like, we connect to a wifi system, similar to that, the band will require a class code, to get 
into the database of the attendance system of that particular class. After that, whenever the band comes in
the range of the router, it will automatically be connected to it, and the recording will start.
So, the time spent database will be working online, whenever it tracks the band, in the vicinity it will activate 
the band's time, and the recording will continue.
So, a single database will be created by a single router. The database will be online for those who are in the vicinity 
or with their bands on their wrists, hence maintaining the record of the attendance.
